Open travel_cost.pdf to read the directions for this case study.

You will use and update the travel_cost.Rmd (R markdown) file once you've installed R, Rstudio, etc.

As you complete your edits/updates to the travel_cost.Rmd file, make sure to save your work.

When you've completed all the questions/tasks, please knit the .Rmd file into a .pdf.

Submit both the finalized .Rmd file and the finalized .pdf file.

Have fun! Please reach out to myself or Yagmur with questions.

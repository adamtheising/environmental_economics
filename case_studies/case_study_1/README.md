# Case Study #1 - The Travel Cost Model (100 points)
This repo provides instructions, code, and data to estimate a travel cost model from [Seller, Stoll, and Chavas (1985)](https://bryanparthum.github.io/environmental_economics/case_studies/case_study_1/papers/Seller_et_al_1985_LandEcon-travel_cost.pdf).

# Install R and RStudio
As mentioned [above](#requirements), this case study requires the use of the *R* programming language. *R* is free and available for download [here](https://www.r-project.org/). While you can use *R* on it's own, downloading *RStudio* will provide you with a welcoming environment (an integrated development environment, or IDE) that is useful for replication. It is free and available for download [here](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/).

# Optional: Install GitHub
*Github* is free and available for download [here](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git). *Github* is used to house this repository and by installing and using it to clone the repository one will simplify the replication procedure. However, you could also simply download a zipped file version of this repository, unzip in the desired location on your machine, and follow the replication procedures outlined below.

# Cloning the Repository
Begin by either cloning this repository or downloading the zipped file. Cloning can be done from the [main page of this repo](https://github.com/bryanparthum/environmental_economics) by clicking on the green "code" button in the top right corner of the page and following those instructions (this will also provide you with an option to download a .zip file of the repository), or by navigating in the terminal to the desired location of the clone and then typing: 

```
git clone https://github.com/bryanparthum/environmental_economics
```

If you chose to download a .zip file of the repository, simply unzip it to wherever you would like to have it and proceed with the following steps in that directory.

# The Travel Cost Model 
To get started with the replication, navigate in your file explorer (or equivalent) to `case_studies/case_study_1` and double click on (open) the markdown file `travel_cost.Rmd`. This will prompt your machine to open the file in *RStudio*. This markdown document includes all the instructions and code to estimate a travel cost model from [Seller, Stoll, and Chavas (1985)](https://bryanparthum.github.io/environmental_economics/case_studies/travel_cost/Seller_et_al_1985_LandEcon-travel_cost.pdf). Follow the steps outlined in the markdown document, and submit the resulting PDF for grading. The points for each step are stated next to each graded section.

# Case Study #3 - Bivariate Mapping (100 points)

This markdown document provides instructions, code, and data to create a bivariate map of environmental quality indicators and demographic information. We will use data from the 2020 5-year ACS and EPA's EJ screening tool known as [EJSCREEN](https://www.epa.gov/ejscreen/download-ejscreen-data). 

# Familar Steps - Install R, Rstudio, and Github
This case study requires the use of the *R* programming language. *R* is available for download [here](https://www.r-project.org/). While you can use *R* on it's own, downloading *RStudio* provides a welcoming environment for replication and allows use of the Rmarkdown functionality. It is available [here](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/).

*Github* is free and available for download [here](https://desktop.github.com/). *Github* is used to house the course repository. Installing and using it to clone the repository will simplify the replication procedure. However, you could also simply download a zipped file version of the repository (instructions below) and unzip in the desired location on your machine.

# Cloning the Repository
To clone or download the [course repository](https://github.com/adamtheising/environmental_economics), navigate to the [main page](https://github.com/adamtheising/environmental_economics) and click on the green "code" button in the top right corner of the page and follow the instructions (this will also provide you with an option to download a .zip file of the repository). Alternatively, navigate in the command line terminal to where you would like to clone the repository and then type:

```
git clone https://github.com/adamtheising/environmental_economics
```

If you chose to download a .zip file of the repository, simply unzip it to wherever you would like to have it and proceed with the following steps in that directory.

# Getting started 
After installing *R*, *RStudio*, and cloning/downloading the repository, navigate in your file explorer (or equivalent) to `case_studies\case_study_3` and open the markdown file `bivariate_mapping.Rmd`. This will open the file in *RStudio*. This markdown document includes all the instructions and code to create a bivariate map.
